# Form Tools Core

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/formtools/core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/formtools/core)

This repo contains the source code for the Form Tools Core. The Core provides the minimal code needed to run Form Tools
on your server. The `master` branch contains the ongoing work on Form Tools 3, currently in *alpha*. Check out the
release sections for earlier, stable releases.


### Form Tools 3

Form Tools 3 (2018) was a complete rewrite of the codebase. Form Tools started back in 2004 and this is the third 
(and hardest!) rewrite. The broader goal was to simply modernize the script, but specifically: to allow it to run on PHP 7,
use PDO, update all lib dependencies up to date, introduce tests and pave the way for upcoming changes and features. 

Currently Form Tools 3 is in alpha and will be headed to beta in the next few days.


### Form Tools 2

Form Tools 2 was the production version from May 2014 onwards. It only supports PHP 4.3 - PHP 5.


### PHP version support

- Everything up to *Form Tools Core 2.2.7* supports PHP 4.3 - 5.x.
- *Form Tools Core 3.0.0* supports PHP 5.3 and later.
