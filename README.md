# Form Tools Core

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/formtools/core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/formtools/core)

This repo contains the source code for the Form Tools Core. The Core provides the minimal code needed to run Form Tools
on your server. The `master` branch contains the ongoing work on Form Tools 3, currently in *alpha*. Check out the
release sections for earlier, stable releases.


### Form Tools 3

Form Tools 3 (2018) was a complete rewrite of the application. Form Tools started back in 2004 and this is the third 
(and hardest!) rewrite. The broader goal was to simply modernize the script, but there were also some specific goals:un on PHP 7, use PDO, update all lib dependencies up to date, introduce tests and pave the way for upcoming changes and features. 

Currently Form Tools 3 is in beta, but it's looking pretty solid. That said - more testing the better! Please report anything you find. 


### Form Tools 2

Form Tools 2 was the production version from 2010 onwards. I took a long, 4-year break to work on other projects, but returned to the Form Tools world in 2016 to revamp the site and code. Form Tools 2 was entirely functional code; FT3 converted everything to object-oriented, because I found it was simply too hard to organize a large codebase without more structure provided by the language.


### PHP version support

- Everything up to *Form Tools Core 2.2.7* supports PHP 4.3 - 5.x.
- *Form Tools Core 3.0.0* supports PHP 5.3 and later.


### Tests

Check out TESTS.md. Still in its infancy, but we're getting there.
